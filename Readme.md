# SwiftUI Practice

A SwiftUI app with a TabView of Views used to demonstrate `@State`, `@StateObject`, `@ObservedObject`, `@EnvironmentObject` and related SwiftUI data-passing methds and how to write unit tests for them.

## Notes

- This app targets iOS 16 so some of the newer SwiftUI features (like `@Observable`) could not be used.
- Unit tests for each view exist and were written using the [View Inspector](https://github.com/nalexn/ViewInspector) library.
- The app icon is from [this free icon pack](https://reffpixels.itch.io/genericicons), however I upscaled it to 1024x1024 so it works as a single file app icon.
