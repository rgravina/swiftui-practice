# SwiftUI Practice

A simple SwiftUI app made for practice purposes.

## Notes

- This app targets iOS 16 so some of the newer SwiftUI features (like `@Observable`) could not be used.
- The App Icon originally is from [this free icon pack](https://reffpixels.itch.io/appicons). I upscaled it to 1024x1024.
